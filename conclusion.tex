\chapter{Conclusion}

The team completed many of the tasks in the competition, and came in the
twelfth position out of the forty-three teams that competed. This included
being the second team to capture the flag in Question 3.2, which was
particularly difficult (only four teams ended up completing that task).

It was unfortunate that the SQL injection in the first section was 
discovered so late in the competition, as it would have been possible to
get quite a few points from the following questions had the team had time.
Had this been found earlier, the subsequent questions may have pushed the team
up into seventh or eighth place.

Far more important than the place the team came though was the amount that
everyone in the team learnt about computer security and penetration testing.
Not only was the preparation for the competition a great learning experience,
but the amount of information learnt during the competition eclipsed this.
