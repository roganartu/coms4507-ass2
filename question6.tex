\chapter{Question 6 - VPN Security Analysis}

\section{Preparation}
The process of setting up a VPN on our own hardware before the competition was
conducted for fun, to give us a platform on which to practice and also to help
use develop a better understanding of VPN configurations and setups for this
section. We spent almost a week wading through a huge amount of configuration
documentation and guides before ultimately putting the VPN together. 

\section{Given Information}
All teams were given a file: vpn-solution.zip\\
It contained a network diagram and the client/server OpenVPN configuration.
\\\\
For each of these areas we had to identify how the current configuration
implements these functions, identify weaknesses in the current configuration and
detail changes that would improve the security of the deployed solution.

\section{Mitigation Question 6.1}
\textbf{Review how the current configuration implements authentication, identify
any weaknesses and detail changes that would improve the security of the
deployed solution}
